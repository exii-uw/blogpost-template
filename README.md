# blogpost-template
Template for blog posts. 

IMPORTANT: I've marked anything that you need to change in the template with a "!!!". Run a search on "!!!" in index.html to find anything that you still need to change.

I've used the bootstrap column layout for pretty much everything here. The majority of the sizes for things are determined by the amount of columns specified in the html classes.

Thanks to Jingjie for the inspiration and permission to make a template out of his original post style!
