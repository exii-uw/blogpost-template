# Paper Blog Post Template
Template for blog posts. 

IMPORTANT: I've marked anything that you need to change in the template with a "!!!". Run a search on "!!!" in index.html and style.css to find anything that you still need to change.

I've used the bootstrap column layout for pretty much everything here. The majority of the sizes for things are determined by the amount of columns specified in the html classes.

Protip, test your OpenGraph information before you publish! Your OpenGraph tags will determine how your link looks when shared on social media.
